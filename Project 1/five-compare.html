                Before you leave this course, we want to invite you to ponder over the following 
                two open-ended questions that you may encounter in practical contexts. Think carefully 
                first and compare your ideas with the insights we provide. You can do it! 
            </p>

            <p>
                Is compound interest always better than simple interest?
            </p>
            <input width = "100" height = "200">

            <p>
            > Not necessarily. The principal amount, rate of interest, as well as the number of years a 
            person invests impacts the final accumulated amount. Starting off with a large principal and 
            doing simple interest, might lead to more total money accumulated, than starting with a low 
            principal and compounding it for the same amount of time. It will depend on your variables, 
            so it is always good to use the skills you have learnt to predict and plan your future finances!
