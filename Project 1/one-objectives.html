              Simple interest is easier to learn and also serves as the foundation of compound interest. </p>

            Letâ€™s say you deposited $10,000 and saved it in the bank for 
            10 years and had an interest rate of 10%. If you earned 10% simple interest every year, 
            you would finish the 10 years with a total interest income of $10,000 
            (I = 10,000 x 0.10 x 10).
        </P>

        <P style='color: #515151;'>
                However, if the interest was compounded, the interest income in each year would be higher 
                than the previous year. And at the end of 10 years, you would have earned $15,937 in 
                interest.
